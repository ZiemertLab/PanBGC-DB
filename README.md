# PanBGC-DB

**PanBGC-DB** is a publicly available database and analysis platform designed to explore the genetic diversity and evolutionary dynamics of biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) families using a pangenome-inspired framework. The platform integrates large-scale BGC datasets from antiSMASH-DB and MIBiG, clusters them into gene cluster families (GCFs), and applies orthologous grouping and openness metrics to characterize core, accessory, and unique genes within each family.

## Features

- Interactive visualization of BGC families and gene presence/absence matrices
- Gene classification into core, accessory, and unique types
- Openness metric calculation using Heapsâ€™ Law
- Comparative views of gene architecture, domain organization, and phylogenetic relationships
- Query tool for uploading and comparing custom BGCs

## Access

The web platform is available at:
